# scripts
Scripts to compute the total energy of atoms from H to Ar using converged PBE densities.
* Non self consistant calculation
* Right now it only works with the basis set 6-311+g(2d,p) download from basis set exchange
* It works with any pyscf functionals
* A function using only exact exchange from Kohn-Sham orbitals was added (EXKS). It should give similar results to Hartree-Fock

# TODO
* Add the exchange-correlation factor
